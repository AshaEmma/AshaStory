A little boy named Ari, walks along a darkened path.
Trees sway back and forth in the wind engulfing him in an
icy chill as the sun is obstructed from sight. Unsure if the 
journey he is about to take is worth it, he slowly looks back
towards the light as if hoping to hear a voice calling him home.
And yet he continues on....
Suddenly, a bear jumped onto the road Ari was walking on. "I can make one of your dreams come true!"Said the bear. Scared the little boy was, but he still bilieved what the bear told him. "Very well then, I want to be rich!" Shouting the boy was.
The bear says, "yes." At the moment, the boy found he is already a millionare but also became much older. He was a little bit unhappy and asked why it happens.
