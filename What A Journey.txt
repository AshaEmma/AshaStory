A little boy named Ari, walks along a darkened path.
Trees sway back and forth in the wind engulfing him in an
icy chill as the sun is obstructed from sight. Unsure if the 
journey he is about to take is worth it, he slowly looks back
towards the light as if hoping to hear a voice calling him home.
And yet he continues on....
Suddenly, a bear jumped onto the road Ari was walking on.
"I can make one of your dreams come true!"Said the bear.
Scared the little boy was, but he still believed what the bear told him.
"Very well then, I want to be rich!" Shouting the boy was.
The bear says, "yes." At the moment, the boy found he is already a millionare but also became much older.
He was a little bit unhappy and asked why it happened.
The Bear/Genie said, "Watch what you wish for, you just might get it!" 
The boy was very upset that he had been tricked. 
The bear saw his sorrow and said, "I could take it back..."
At that moment the little boy agreed.
"Your wish is my command" said the bear.
Suddely the boy saw all the riches around him disappear. However his age remained the same.
The boy, now an older man, was quite disappointed and asked the bear why he was now an old man.
The bear repplied "You didn't wish that I reverse your age I simply gave you what you wished for"
The man demaned that he receive another wish. "Your wish is my command" said the bear, 
"But I must warn you, this will be your final...". "Yes I know how it works" said the boy. 
"I wish you could reverse my age" The boy found himself as an infant unclothed on the forest floor,
but his mind remained in tact and he recalled all that happened to him. He tried to cry out for help
but he could no longer form the words and the bear had simply dissappeared as he appeared. The boy
remained on the forest floor for days until he slowly starved, for no one was foolish enough to take that
darkened path as he did. The END
